## Hello, I'm Angela ðŸ‘‹



I'm a Statistics student at Imperial College London. I'm learning **Data Science** and **Computational Statistics and Machine Learning**. I love using statistical and programming toolkits to solve real-word problems and innovate the old statistical methodology where it is necessary. I previously worked as a biostatisian for the Breast Cancer Surgey Team at Cornell University.
